# React-Weather-App

Welcome to my React.js Weather App! This is a fully functional react app that uses
the OpenWeatherMap API to display location, temperature, weather description, feels like
temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The search bar is fully functional and to look
up weather simply type in the city you want to display weather for. This application utilizes
React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Since this application is not published on the internet, to run it
open the git-hub repo on vscode, cd into 'weather-app', open terminal, and type 'npm start'.
For security reasons, the API key is removed so the app will not be functional as is. To get
the API key, visit https://openweathermap.org/api, click on API > Current Weather Data > Subscribe > and copy
and paste your personal key into the denoted space.

This application was built following a tutorial by Code Commerce. This is my first iteration of the
weather app and I plan on implementing the Google Places API to add a list of cities as you are typing.
